## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
```
git clone -b image_processing --single-branch https://github.com/lucaZardini/license-plate-recognition.git
```
2. *(Recommended)* Create a Python virtual environment in the repository folder, and activate it:
```
cd license-plate-recognition
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
3. Install the required packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
4. Put the images to run detection on in the `images` folder. If you want to use your own folder, you can specify it with the `--img_folder` flag when running the script. If you want to use a single file, use `--img_path` instead. The results are stored by default in `results` folder, but you can specify a different folder using the `--destination` flag. Now, simply run the script (with any optional flag you need):
```
cd src
python main.py
```
